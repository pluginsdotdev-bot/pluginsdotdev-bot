# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
Iâ€™m @pluginsdotdev-bot, your friendly bot from [Plugins.dev](https://plugins.dev), the easiest way to establish your appâ€™s secure, revenue-generating plugin ecosystem.

## Why plugins?

Users are delightfully insatiable--the more they invest in creating content in your app and building your service into their daily workflows, the more they demand.

More features, more integrations, more customization.

Once your app becomes a platform for creativity, you must support an ecosystem of 3rd-party plugins or risk falling behind in meeting your users' demands.

That's where we come in.

## How we can help

At [Plugins.dev](https://plugins.dev), we enable any app to host 3rd-party plugins completely securely.

We generate a customizable plugin marketplace for your app and create a world-class developer experience for prospective plugin authors.

Using our simple React APIs, you can add plugin points to your app in minutes and start approving 3rd-party plugins as they roll in.

Users can buy or enable plugins for themselves or for groups they administer and immediately start extending the functionality of your app to meet their needs without you lifting a finger.

Get started now at [Plugins.dev](https://plugins.dev) or drop us a line at developers@plugins.dev.
